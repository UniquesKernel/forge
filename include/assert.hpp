 *  @brief A requirement characterizes a condition that must hold under correct usage

 *  @invariant Produces no side effects.
 *  @invariant Forces the return of an error code.
 *
 *  @param[in] condition        The condition or property that should be satisfied.
 *  @param[in] error_code       The error code that should be returned.

/**
 *  @brief An invariant characterizes a condition or property that the invokee guarantees to be satisfied

 *  An invariant defines a property or condition that the invokee of a piece of code

 *
 *  @invariant Halts the process if the condition or property fails.
 *
 *  @param[in] condition        The condition that should be satisfied to continue execution of the program.

 *  invariant to indicate that a failed condition is of no interest to the invoker because no reasonable
 *  action can be taken by either the invokee or the invoker to address the issue caused by the failed
